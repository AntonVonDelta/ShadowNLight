# ShadowNLight
Simulate light. Js implemetation

Simulate light and shadows with multiple modes. 

# How to uses
To create a barrier click on the screen twice to define a line.
You can choose from multiple modes: Fast and Fancy. Fast will assume the light doesn't loose power over distance thus it covers all the screen.
Fancy mode implements a small gradient generating code. For this mode you can select the accuracy of the light(in how many steps it diminishes)

There are 3 keyboard modes activated by buttons : q -fixes the light source in place, a - hides all barriers, s - highlight visible segments.
